# Teeth Classification using CNN (Week 1)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end computer vision solution for **dental teeth image classification**.  
The goal is to classify dental images into **7 distinct classes** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch**.

This work represents **Week 1** of the project and focuses on:
- Data preprocessing
- Data visualization
- CNN baseline model training

The project is part of an AI-driven healthcare initiative aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy in dental applications.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Prepare dental images for training through **normalization and data augmentation**
- Visualize the **class distribution** to analyze dataset balance
- Display **images before and after augmentation**
- Build and train a **CNN model from scratch** using TensorFlow
- Establish a **baseline performance** for future improvements

## 🧪 Dataset & Preprocessing
- Dental images were resized and normalized to improve training stability
- Pixel values were scaled to the range **[0, 1]**
- Data augmentation techniques were applied to enhance generalization, including:
  - Rotation
  - Horizontal flipping
  - Zooming

These steps help reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the model.

---

## 📊 Data Visualization
The notebook includes multiple visualizations to better understand the dataset and model behavior:
- **Class distribution plots** to analyze dataset balance
- **Original vs augmented image comparisons**
- **Training vs validation accuracy curves**
- **Training vs validation loss curves**

These visualizations confirm stable learning behavior and good generalization.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
A **CNN model built from scratch** was implemented with the following components:
- Multiple `Conv2D` layers for feature extraction
- `MaxPooling2D` layers for spatial downsampling
- `GlobalAveragePooling2D` to reduce parameters and prevent overfitting
- Fully connected (`Dense`) layers for classification
- `Dropout` layers for regularization

A visual representation of the architecture is provided in:

## 📈 Training Results
- The model achieved strong baseline performance:
  - High training and validation accuracy
  - Smooth convergence of loss curves
  - No significant overfitting observed
- Minor validation fluctuations are expected due to data augmentation

This baseline model will be used as a reference point for future improvements.
